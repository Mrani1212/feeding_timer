# feeding_timer
timer when feeding and to keep track of when and for how long


Implementation Notes:
For full functionality:

Host all files on an HTTPS server

Place all files in the same directory

Add the icon image files

For best iOS performance:

Add to home screen (Safari Share > Add to Home Screen)

Keep the app open in a browser tab when not using the home screen version

The app will:

Work in background (as much as iOS allows)

Show notifications when timer completes

Save your history between sessions

Allow exporting your feeding history
